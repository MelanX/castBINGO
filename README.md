### This modpack puts your knowledge to the test!

This is the official repository of the Minecraft modpack `castBINGO!` on
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/castbingo)!
It contains all necessary files to create a server and to create a client .zip file for importing into any known
launcher which can import the default CurseForge modpack files.

Releases for server and client files can be found [here](https://github.com/MelanX/castBINGO/releases).

## Content
### Basic

The included content in the folders are only the files which were changed. If a config isn't changed, it doesn't need
to be here. It will be automatically generated on first launch of the modpack.

### Server Data

The serverdata is custom for the official Bingo Events on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/castcrafter).
